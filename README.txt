Welcome to Alex Salman simple while program :)

You will need the following to run my program, enter input and see result:

1 - Install python 3.8
2 - On your terminal, change your directory to cse210A-asgtest-hw2-while folder
3 - Type in $ python3 while.py
4 - Enter the statement you want to execute such as, if true then x := 1 else x := 0
5 - You will see the result on the next line, for the above example, it's {x â†’ 1}


Thank you for using my program and stay tuned for more advanced programs!
